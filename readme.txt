Project Name: Clue
Project Description: The name of my term project is Clue, and it will be pretty similar to the 
current board game version. The idea is for the player to interact with the computer and try to 
win against it. At the start of the game, the game will automatically choose a suspect (out of 6 total), 
a weapon (out of 6 total), and a room (out of 9 total). The player and computer will take turns rolling the 
die and moving around the game board, entering different rooms, and making guesses as to what they believe is 
the correct answer (the suspect, weapon, and room chosen at the beginning). Rooms can  only be entered through
certain spots marked with doors and also include back staircases that lead to other rooms. Each of the players
will be dealt cards with the rest of the suspects, weapons, and rooms not chosen as the correct answer and 
they must use that to help them eliminate choices. Once in a room, the player can make a guess and the opposing 
players will then say if they have any cards that prove your guess to be wrong and tell you which card. To make
the final accusation at the end, the player must be in the center room on the board. (The rules are 
essentially the same as the actual board game, however this game is limited to one player versus the computer).

To run the project, download the zip file and just run the file called TermProject.py. The images should all 
be in an images folder and work through the zip file.

No libraries need to be installed, I only import cmu_112_graphics, math, random, and copy.

To skip forward in the game and enter final accusations to test right and wrong answers,
use the button on the bottom left corner that reads "ANSWER"
